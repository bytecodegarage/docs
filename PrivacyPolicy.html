<h2><strong>Privacy Policy for FlexGauge</strong></h2>
<p>ByteCodeGarage ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of users of our mobile application FlexGauge ("the App"). This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of user information. By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>1. Information Collection:</strong></p>
<p>The App does not collect any personally identifiable information from users. We do not request or store any personal data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or any other information that can be used to identify individuals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Location Information:</strong></p>
<p>The App requests access to your device's location information solely for the purpose of providing location-based services relevant to informational gauge displays on the app, such as displaying speed or miles traveled. However, this information is processed locally on the user's device and is not transmitted or stored by us.</p>
<p><strong>3. Data logging:</strong></p>
<p>The app logs all sensor data to files viewable by the user in the form of recordings. They are deleted after several days by default. The retention duration is configurable by the user. Logs may be deleted by the user via the user interface. Logs are only kept on the device and not uploaded to the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>4. Debugging Log Data:</strong></p>
<p>The App may collect non-personal information in the form of development debugging log data, which includes details about your device, operating system, and usage of the App. This information is used for debugging purposes and improving the functionality of the App. Log data is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Third-Party Services:</strong></p>
<p>The app has no third-party service integrations and therefore no means for a third party to collect user information.</p>
<p><strong>6. Security:</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected by the App. This includes security measures provided by the Android platform for guarding private app data.</p>
